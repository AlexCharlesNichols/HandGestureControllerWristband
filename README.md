# HandGestureControllerWristband

This example shows how you can use TensorFlow Lite to run a 20 kilobyte neural
network model to recognize gestures with an accelerometer. It's designed to run
on systems with very small amounts of memory, such as microcontrollers.

The example application reads data from the accelerometer on an Arduino Nano 33
BLE Sense 


## Deploy to Arduino

Usign the files in the src folder, download them all and run in a c++ environment

## Train your own model
# 1.

To train your own model, or create a new model for a new set of gestures,
follow the instructions in [/train/README.md](https://https://github.com/AlexCharlesNichols/HandGestureControllerWristband/blob/main/train/README.md).

# 2.

to send signals from arduino to a MATLAB program
see files in the Central Bluetooth folder and run in a MATLAB environment
